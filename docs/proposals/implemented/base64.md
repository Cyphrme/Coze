# base64: Support base64 encoded values.

## Problem: Hex Coze messages are longer than JWT

Coze messages are larger than they would be with base64 values. Coze messages
can be (much) smaller than JWTs if base64 encoded.  

For example, when compactified the following is 298 characters.  
```json
{
"pay": {
 "alg": "ES256",
 "iat": 1623132000,
 "msg": "Coze Rocks",
 "tmb": "0148F4CD9093C9CBE3E8BF78D3E6C9B824F11DD2F29E2B1A630DD1CE1E176CDD",
 "typ": "cyphr.me/msg/create"
},
"sig": "E848D97CA3A1BAE8C1AE6ACBAE1E73B7C23C9A74581003CAEB4FCBA4EF39EC8B07996B4F52F5D5925C48A793C54495A3B89DD9A8B55D29E72B8B9DF599E0A734"
}
```

A comparable JWT is smaller at 280 characters.  

```jwt
eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJtc2ciOiJDb3plIFJvY2tzIiwiaWF0IjoxNjI3NTE4MDAwLCJ0bWIiOiJyYkxYM1NzV0xXQkpvSXFNUENOVUZ1VURScFZVX28tMFNERms4WWxURXU4IiwidHlwIjoiY3lwaHIubWUvbXNnL2NyZWF0ZSJ9.7uLr31zS5_I-UeJWj4Olrufu9C7sr2-2DB4dDyKY4yf3g6Jr30JSLS3wfyMEWUbW1OVAzsB1wYhaWbUz0VWtGA
```

Although 19 more characters or about 6% larger isn't bad, we'd like Coze to
simply be better.  

Coze would be smaller if base64 was used.  The following is 235 characters, 45
characters and 16% smaller than a comparable JWT.    

```json
{
"pay": {
 "alg": "ES256",
 "iat": 1623132000,
 "msg": "Coze Rocks",
 "tmb": "AUj0zZCTycvj6L940-bJuCTxHdLynisaYw3Rzh4XbN0",
 "typ": "cyphr.me/msg/create"
},
"sig": "6EjZfKOhuujBrmrLrh5zt8I8mnRYEAPK60_LpO857IsHmWtPUvXVklxIp5PFRJWjuJ3ZqLVdKecri531meCnNA"
}
```
Note: this "conversion" is incorrect since `tmb` should be computed using base64 values.  



# Problems
Since `alg` already defines sizes and values are padded, encoding is discernible
from `alg` and string length.

For example, for alg: "ES256", "tmb" is 64 in Hex and 43 in base64.

- The Hex `tmb`, `cad`, `czd`, and `sig` are not directly encodable to base64
  since they would be computed with different encoding.  The base64 `tmb`
  would need to be digest of the base64 representation of Coze key.  

	The key components `d`, `x`, and `y` are directly encodable to base64.  

### Solutions
1. Sign, verify, and generate values like `cad` and `tmb` using the Hex form and
directly convert, but this would burden all implementations with Hex.  This is a
bad choice.  

2. Sign, verify, and generate values like `cad` and `tmb` using the byte form.
   This means that user specified fields need to be known as encoded.  We don't
   solution for this at the moment. 

	 2.1 Can be computed using all forms, and then any form can be looked up. so a
	 Hex tmb, base64 tmb, and a bytes tmb.  

	 2.2 Use an identifier for base64.  
		- 0X for Hex, but what for base64?  `b64`, `64x`?

3. Each form uses it's own encoding.  This means that keys have a hextmb and
   base64tmb

4. Deprecate Hex and use just base64.

Current rank: 4, 3, 2 and 1 isn't viable.  




## Why not deprecate Hex?
1. Hex is human readable.  
 A. Small alphabet. 
 B. No doppelg√§ngers (O0I1l)
2. Hex is phonetic
	A. Many people know how to pronounce Hex. 
	B. "-" and "_" is difficult for some people to pronounce.  
3. We want to support even more efficient encodings in the future.
4. It's easier to read.  

Minor: 
- JSON5 supports a Hex signifier while no signifier for base64 


## Why Deprecate Hex
- While Hex is easier to read, it's also longer.  
- Hex is 200% of binary while base64 is ~133%
- Future more efficient encodings don't appear feasible.
	- basE91 is not JSON safe.  
	- base85 is a more reasonable pick, and it's only ~7% more efficient.  
	- base-122 is neat but only more effient in transport and when compression isn't used.  
- gzip compression is really efficient with base64.
- Added complexity
- Design would be easier with a signifier for base.  

From a Coze design perspective:
- Coze isn't support to be super efficient, it's suppose to be human readable
  firstly and reasonably efficient secondly.  
- A more efficient version of Coze would just be a binary standard and not JSON.  
- At rest we store as bytes.  So transport and "raw" unparsed Coze is the only
place this is relevant.  


# Other Considerations

## Consideration for using length in determining length
This proposal uses string length instead of an addition identifier for base64.

Currently, if the lengths are wrong an error should be thrown.  That logic will
be the same with the added inclusion of base64 lengths, which can be calculated
by (4/3 * number of bytes) rounded up to the nearest integer.

Single byte Hex, e.g. with two values `FF`, would be indiscernable from the
base64 `_w` based on length.  All other longer values are discernable:  the
Hex `FF01` converts to base64`_wE`.

This situation is considered unlikely and is considered to be an acceptable
cost.  Since Coze specifies that values are always padded, if this ever was a
problem, padding to two bytes would be suggested, e.g. the Hex "00FF" converts
to base64 "AP8".

## Consideration for RFC 4648
RFC 4648 base64 URI truncated (b64ut) is the selected encoding (padding
characters removed and use the base64url alphabet). 

## Consideration for mixed encoding
Mixed encoding should be unsupported and should result in an error. This is
simpler to implement.  All relevant lengths can be checked and if any do not
match any operation should error.  All standard Coze messages and keys should
have an encoded payload, such as "tmb", to perform the switching over.  

Alternatively, each string's length would need to be checked individually or
signified.  

If a system wants to sign something from another encoding or mixed encoding,
convert to the desired encoding before signing.  


## Considered Alternatives
1. Use an `alg` identifier for base64 encoding.  "_64"

If an identifier is used, it should be applied first to Hex, and not base64
since Hex is longer.  If a systems is using the longer form wouldn't care about
the 


# Conclusion
Deprecate Hex and move to base64.

### JOSE Invalid hypothetical unencoded JWT:
 A JWT in the invalid "unencoded" representation, with the header and
payload unencoded, is 240 characters.  JOSE always encodes headers as base64,
**even in the "unencoded" option**, so this efficient hypothetical isn't
valid in JOSE.
